#The program reads a file with 20 students' names and GWAs, then outputs the name of the student with the highest GWA.

# open the file containing the student data
# read the contents of the file into a str variable
# split the str variable into a list of lines
# initialize variables to store the highest GWA and the name of the student who got it
# loop through each line in the file
# split the line into two parts: the student's name and their GWA
# convert the GWA from a string to a float
# if this student has a higher GWA than the current highest GWA, update the variables
# close the file
# print the output
